<<< TO DO >>>

[IN PROGRESS] --> Basic lighting
	--> frag shader lighting

--> PBR

	--> Renderable struct 

<<< BUGS >>>

--> Vulkan warning about descriptor sets that aren't destroyed

<<< CLEANUP >>>

--> Indent member function and variables and group them logically

--> [LOW PRIO] Remove usage of STL containers and replace with pure arrays
	--> Benchmark this to find out if it is even worth doing

--> [LOW PRIO] Purge std::shared_ptr and std::unique_ptr from codebase
	--> Use normal pointers because we are in the wild west


<<< COMPLETED >>>

--> Game directory
	--> Now that the renderer has full potential functionality (already static linked as library)
		start making the game files as well
